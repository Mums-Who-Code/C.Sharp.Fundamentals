# C# Fundamentals Learning Path
In this learning track, you will be presented with reading materials and coding tasks. This track will provide you a basic knowledge of C# programming language. After completing this track you are ready to take on the next track 'C# - Basic Software Operations'

## Steps
1. Pick your first task
2. Create an issue for the task under your named repository
3. Open the task link, if there is no outcome (listed in the task), close the issue after completing your reading
4. Open the task link, if there is an outcome (listed in the task), 
   - Clone the repository
   - Get the latest main
   - Create a user branch from main
   - Create a solution under the cloned folder (if not created)
   - Create a console application project under the solution (Ex: Set1Task2, Set1Task3)
   - Complete the coding in the Program.cs
   - Create a pull request
   - Link the issue created in Step 2
   - Merge the PR after approval
5. Pick the next task and go to Step 2
